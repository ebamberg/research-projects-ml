Here are his main takeaways:Welcome back.Bove traced Pecker\\u2019s long relationship with Trump, showing how he helped his friend long before the presidential election. Pecker spoke about how he gave Trump a heads up about a negative story about Trump\\u2019s then wife, Marla Maples.Trump addressed the media as he left the courtroom, describing Pecker\\u2019s testimony as \\u201cbreathtaking and amazing\\u201d. \\u201cThis is a trial that should\\u2019ve never happened, this is a case that should\\u2019ve never been filed and it was really an incredible, an incredible day,\\u201d he told reporters.Pecker said he agreed to buy a story from the Playboy model Karen McDougal specifically to bury it so that it did not \\u201cembarrass or hurt the [Trump] campaign\\u201d. He said a $150,000 payment he agreed to make to McDougal in August 2016 was so his publication could \\u201ckill\\u201d McDougal\\u2019s story about a 10-month affair she says she had with Trump a decade earlier. The jury was shown records of the $150,000 payment, including an invoice from McDougal\\u2019s lawyer.Pecker said Trump called him for advice after he became a presidential candidate, telling him \\u201cKaren is a nice girl\\u201d, and that he was worried news of the affair would hurt his campaign. \\u201cI think you should buy the story and take it off the market,\\u201d Pecker recalled telling Trump.Pecker said he worked with the former National Enquirer editor-in-chief, Dylan Howard, and Trump\\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen to facilitate the payment. Pecker admitted that the goal of the paper\\u2019s publisher American Media Inc (AMI) was to try to prevent the story from interfering with the Trump campaign, and that he was concerned the payment could violate federal campaign finance law.But Pecker said things turned sour when he ultimately backed out of the agreement. Pecker confirmed that AMI consulted with an election law attorney, and that Cohen was \\u201cvery, very angry, screaming basically\\u201d about it.Pecker said he received a frantic call from Howard in early October 2016, saying Stormy Daniels was trying to sell a story about her sexual relationship with Trump. He said Howard claimed Daniels wanted $120,000 for the story. Pecker said he did not want to be involved with a porn star, and that Cohen told him \\u201cthe boss will be very angry with you\\u201d.Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass repeatedly tied Trump\\u2019s motive for quashing the story to protecting his presidential campaign. The prosecution\\u2019s case is that it was interference in the 2016 election, which Trump won. \\u201cI made the assumption that his concern was the campaign,\\u201d Pecker said when asked if Trump ever expressed any concern for his wife and children.
