This Git repository showcases some machine-learnkng research projects I have been working on and tested overtime.
The repository doesn't contains productivity ready code.The projects are mostly code based on tutorial and getting started blogs I played around out of interest and curiosity.

Two notable projects: the finetuning of LLama 3.1 and the implementation of Control Nets with diffusers.


## Project 1: LLM Finetuning of LLama 3.1
### Overview
The first project in this repository focuses on the finetuning of LLama 3.1, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM). LLama 3.1 is renowned for its capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, making it a powerful tool for various applications, including chatbots, content creation, and language translation.

### Key Features
Advanced Natural Language Processing: LLama 3.1 excels in understanding and generating human-like text, making it suitable for a wide range of NLP tasks.

Customization through Finetuning: This project demonstrates how to finetune LLama 3.1 for specific applications, enhancing its performance and relevance to particular use cases.

Implementation Details
The finetuning process involves adjusting the model's parameters to better suit specific datasets and tasks. This project includes scripts and guidelines for setting up the finetuning environment, preparing the dataset, and executing the finetuning process. By following these instructions, developers can customize LLama 3.1 to meet their unique requirements.

## Project 2: Diffusers - How to Use Control Nets
### Overview
The second project in the repository focuses on the use of Control Nets with diffusers. Diffusers are a type of neural network architecture designed for various image and signal processing tasks. Control Nets, in this context, provide a mechanism to guide the diffusion process, improving the model's ability to generate and refine outputs.

### Key Features
Enhanced Image Processing: Diffusers with Control Nets are particularly effective in image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks.

Guided Diffusion: Control Nets allow for more precise control over the diffusion process, leading to higher quality and more accurate results.

Implementation Details
This project provides a comprehensive guide on how to implement Control Nets with diffusers. It includes sample code, detailed instructions, and best practices for integrating Control Nets into existing diffuser models.
